# Concept

Cloud Runner is an open-source tool for Unity projects that makes it easy and reliable to run automated tasks. Instead of running them locally, Cloud Builder starts a Cloud server on-demand and streams the results back to you.

Cloud Builder can cache large files and the Unity Library (imported assets) in Cloud Storage to make builds fast. Cloud Builder only needs to pull the files that change to run more than once.

The most common automated task Cloud Builder is used for is to Build, Test and Deploy a Unity project.

However, you can use Cloud Builder to run any automated work that requires the Unity Editor.
